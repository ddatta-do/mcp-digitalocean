## Example Queries Using Networking MCP Tools

- Create a new domain "example.com" pointing to IP "203.0.113.10".
- Add an A record to "example.com" for "www" pointing to "203.0.113.20".
- Delete the TXT record with ID 12345 from "example.com".
- Create a new SSL certificate for "myapp.com".
- Delete a firewall with ID "abcd-1234".
- Add HTTP and HTTPS inbound rules to firewall "fw-123".
- Remove SSH access rule from firewall "fw-456".
- Reserve a new IPv4 in region "nyc3".
- Assign reserved IP "198.51.100.5" to droplet 987654.
- Create a new VPC named "private-net" in region "sfo2".
- Flush the cache for CDN with ID "cdn-xyz" for file "/static/logo.png".
- Create a partner attachment named "fast-connect" in region "nyc3" with 1000 Mbps bandwidth.

## Notes

- All resource identifiers (IDs, names, IPs) must be replaced with actual values in your queries.
- All responses are returned in JSON format for easy parsing and integration.
- For endpoints that require an ID, name, or IP, replace the placeholder with the appropriate value.
- Use the tools to automate and manage all aspects of DigitalOcean networking from domains and DNS to VPCs, firewalls, and advanced partner connectivity.
